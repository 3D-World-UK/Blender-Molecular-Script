[x] fix zero devision can happen in somes normal cases
[x] Separate compression / expansion stiffness
[x] Link tension ( bigger or smaller than when is created )
[x] Max links per particles option
[x] Bake when finish option
[x] start render when finish option
[x] Free the memory when finish or stopped
[x] Max velocity info to give some keys on how much substeps needed
[x] Multithread kdtree searching
[x] Multithread kdtree creation
[x] Link search distance relative to particles size option
[x] Time scale instead of FPS
[x] Fix UI bug when object without pSystem are selected.
[x] Print: new links at this frames , total links from beginning and links broken
[ ] ***Deeper profiling before doing setp below***
[ ] Optimisation in the code ( kdtree search and creation take most of the time when profiling )
[ ] clean and comments the code
[ ] Try to see if I can send info of particles by memory adress to gain speed (like Mohamed does for it's mesher addon)
[ ] Multithread particles collisions and links solving
[ ] Make link exponent work more propertly
