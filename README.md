Blender-Molecular-Script
========================

This is the 3D-World fork of Blender Molecular Script.
The original links and documentation described in the readme of the base repository no longer work. For this reason I have made a backup which can be found under the docs directory of this repository.

The build has been updated to work with Blender 2.93 and above using the associated 3.9 version of the Python runtime.
Please check releases for the latest compiled zip files
These can be installed into Blender using the standard addon installation process. Be sure to download the correct zip for your platform.
